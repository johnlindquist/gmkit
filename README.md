# gmcli

A standalone Go CLI that connects to Google Messages, archives conversations
into a local SQLite + FTS5 database, and exposes a query surface suitable for
shell use and LLM tool integrations.

> **Status:** alpha. Pairing, session persistence, sync loop, query CLI
> (`messages`, `contacts`, `chats`), best-effort history backfill, send
> commands, media download, and an LLM skill (`skills/google-messages`) are
> wired up. The automated test suite passes, but gmcli should be treated as
> alpha until it has broader live-device testing. See
> [`docs/research/phase-1-libgmessages.md`](docs/research/phase-1-libgmessages.md)
> for the design notes that motivated this layout, and
> [`skills/README.md`](skills/README.md) for the skill installation guide.

## What it is

- **Standalone.** No Matrix server, no Docker, no bridge daemon. Just a Go
  binary, a SQLite file, and a phone running Google Messages.
- **Read-first.** Phone-mutating operations (sending texts and reactions) are
  gated behind explicit flags. The default is to observe, not to send.
- **Local.** Messages live in a single SQLite database under your data
  directory (XDG-compliant). Nothing is uploaded anywhere.
- **AGPL-3.0.** gmcli imports `pkg/libgm` from
  [mautrix/gmessages](https://github.com/mautrix/gmessages), which is licensed
  AGPL-3.0. That makes gmcli a derivative work and obligates the same license
  for the whole program. See `LICENSE` and `NOTICE`.

## How it works

`pkg/libgm` reverse-engineers the Google Messages web client protocol. After a
one-time QR pairing handshake, it maintains an authenticated session with
your paired phone — all messages flow through the phone, which proxies them
to Google's relay infrastructure. gmcli wraps that session with an event loop
that writes incoming messages, conversation updates, and contact data to a
local SQLite database, and exposes the database through a CLI.

The phone must be online and have Google Messages installed for the relay to
work. Pairing tokens are refreshed automatically; full re-pairing is required
roughly every 14 days of inactivity (Google's policy, not ours).

## Install

Requires Go 1.24 or newer.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/fdsouvenir/gmcli
cd gmcli
go build -o gmcli .
```

A pre-built binary distribution and Homebrew formula will land alongside the
v0.1 release.

## Alpha limits

- Live-device coverage is still limited. Before relying on gmcli unattended,
  test `auth`, `sync`, query commands, `history backfill`, `media download`,
  and a deliberate send with your own Google Messages account.
- History backfill is best-effort and depends on what Google Messages returns
  through the paired phone.
- The phone must be online for sync, backfill, sends, and media downloads.
- The SQLite database is local but unencrypted. Use filesystem encryption if
  you need at-rest protection.
- The protocol depends on the unofficial `libgm` reverse-engineered Google
  Messages web protocol and can break if Google changes that protocol.

## Quick start

```sh
# 1. One-time pairing (renders a QR code in the terminal — scan with the
#    Google Messages app on your phone, Settings → Device pairing → QR code).
gmcli auth

# 2. Sync messages from the phone into the local database. --follow keeps
#    the connection open and writes new messages as they arrive.
gmcli sync --follow

# 3. Query the local archive (read-only).
gmcli chats list                              # most-recent conversations
gmcli chats show <conversation-id>            # header + recent messages
gmcli messages search "dinner"                # FTS5 across all conversations
gmcli messages list --conv <conv-id>          # message list with filters
gmcli messages show <message-id>              # single message detail
gmcli messages context <message-id>           # surrounding messages
gmcli contacts search alice                   # name/number/alias substring match
gmcli contacts show <participant-id-or-num>   # contact detail

# 4. Local-only labels.
gmcli contacts alias set --id <pid> --alias "Mom"
gmcli contacts alias list                     # list all set aliases
gmcli contacts alias rm --id <pid>

# 5. Best-effort history backfill, modeled after wacli.
gmcli history backfill --chat <conv-id> --requests 10 --count 50

# 6. Write to the phone (always requires --read-only=false).
gmcli --read-only=false send text --to <conv-id> --message "on my way"
gmcli --read-only=false send react --message <msg-id> --emoji "👍"
gmcli media download --message <msg-id>

# Every command supports --json for machine-readable output and --full to
# disable truncation in tables.
gmcli --json chats list | jq '.[0].name'
```

## LLM integration

`skills/google-messages/SKILL.md` is a Claude Code / OpenClaw–compatible
skill that wraps `gmcli` so an assistant can answer questions like "what
did Alice text me about dinner?" or "search my messages for flight
confirmation". The skill always invokes `gmcli --read-only --json`,
includes a verb decision tree, and carries a strong prompt-injection
preamble: untrusted message content is treated as data, never as
instructions. See [`skills/README.md`](skills/README.md) for install
instructions.

## Privacy

- All data is local. gmcli does not phone home.
- Session tokens are stored in `$XDG_STATE_HOME/gmcli/session.json` with mode
  0600.
- Media attachments are referenced by ID in the database; bytes are not
  downloaded by default. Use `gmcli media download --message <message-id>`
  for explicit downloads.
- The SQLite file is unencrypted. If you need at-rest encryption, layer your
  own filesystem encryption (FileVault, LUKS, etc.).

# gmcli

A standalone Go CLI that connects to Google Messages, archives conversations
into a local SQLite + FTS5 database, and exposes a query surface suitable for
shell use and LLM tool integrations — plus a daemon (`gmcli serve`), an MCP
server for AI agents (`gmcli mcp`), and a Rust terminal UI
([`gmtui/`](gmtui/)) with a human approval queue for agent-proposed sends.

## What it is

- **Standalone.** No Matrix server, no Docker, no bridge daemon. Just a Go
  binary, a SQLite file, and a phone running Google Messages.
- **Read-first.** Phone-mutating operations (sending texts and reactions) are
  gated behind explicit flags. The default is to observe, not to send.
- **Local.** Messages live in a single SQLite database under your data
  directory (XDG-compliant). Nothing is uploaded anywhere.
- **AGPL-3.0.** gmcli imports `pkg/libgm` from
  [mautrix/gmessages](https://github.com/mautrix/gmessages), which is licensed
  AGPL-3.0. That makes gmcli a derivative work and obligates the same license
  for the whole program. See `LICENSE` and `NOTICE`.

## How it works

`pkg/libgm` reverse-engineers the Google Messages web client protocol. After a
one-time QR pairing handshake, it maintains an authenticated session with
your paired phone — all messages flow through the phone, which proxies them
to Google's relay infrastructure. gmcli wraps that session with an event loop
that writes incoming messages, conversation updates, and contact data to a
local SQLite database, and exposes the database through a CLI.

The phone must be online and have Google Messages installed for the relay to
work. Pairing tokens are refreshed automatically; full re-pairing is required
roughly every 14 days of inactivity (Google's policy, not ours).

## Install

Requires Go 1.24 or newer.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/fdsouvenir/gmcli
cd gmcli
go build -o gmcli .
```

For a source build whose `gmcli version` output includes the current tag or
commit, inject it at link time:

```sh
go build -ldflags "-X github.com/fdsouvenir/gmcli/cmd.Version=$(git describe --tags --always --dirty)" -o gmcli .
```

Pre-built binary distribution and Homebrew packaging are planned after the
initial beta releases.

## Current limits

- Live-device coverage is still limited. Before relying on gmcli unattended,
  test `auth`, `sync`, query commands, `history backfill`, `media download`,
  and a deliberate send with your own Google Messages account.
- History backfill is best-effort and depends on what Google Messages returns
  through the paired phone.
- The phone must be online for sync, backfill, sends, and media downloads.
- The SQLite database is local but unencrypted. Use filesystem encryption if
  you need at-rest protection.
- The protocol depends on the unofficial `libgm` reverse-engineered Google
  Messages web protocol and can break if Google changes that protocol.

## Quick start

```sh
# 1. One-time pairing (renders a QR code in the terminal — scan with the
#    Google Messages app on your phone, Settings → Device pairing → QR code).
gmcli auth

# 2. Sync messages from the phone into the local database. --follow keeps
#    the connection open and writes new messages as they arrive.
gmcli sync --follow

# 3. Query the local archive (read-only).
gmcli chats list                              # most-recent conversations
gmcli chats show <conversation-id>            # header + recent messages
gmcli messages search "dinner"                # FTS5 across all conversations
gmcli messages list --conv <conv-id>          # message list with filters
gmcli messages show <message-id>              # single message detail
gmcli messages context <message-id>           # surrounding messages
gmcli contacts search alice                   # name/number/alias substring match
gmcli contacts show <participant-id-or-num>   # contact detail

# 4. Local-only labels.
gmcli contacts alias set --id <pid> --alias "Mom"
gmcli contacts alias list                     # list all set aliases
gmcli contacts alias rm --id <pid>

# 5. Best-effort history backfill, modeled after wacli.
gmcli history backfill --chat <conv-id> --requests 10 --count 50
# JSON output reports protocol records separately from the chat message delta:
# fetched_messages, sync_records_processed, messages_before, messages_after,
# messages_added_for_chat.

# 6. Write to the phone (always requires --read-only=false).
gmcli --read-only=false send text --to <conv-id> --message "on my way"
gmcli --read-only=false send react --message <msg-id> --emoji "👍"
gmcli media download --message <msg-id>
# `send text` only reports success after Google Messages echoes the outgoing
# message back with its canonical message_id.

# Every command supports --json for machine-readable output and --full to
# disable truncation in tables.
gmcli --json chats list | jq '.[0].name'
```

## Daemon, TUI, and agents

The daemon keeps the session alive, streams events into the archive, and
exposes a JSON-RPC surface over a unix socket (`<store>/gmcli.sock`,
documented in [`docs/rpc-protocol.md`](docs/rpc-protocol.md)). **You
normally never start it yourself**: gmtui, `gmcli mcp`, and `gmcli
approvals` auto-start it on demand (`serve --auto`) and it exits on its own
after ten minutes without clients. Run it manually only when you want
different behavior:

```sh
gmcli serve                      # always-on, read-only: query surface only
gmcli --read-only=false serve    # always-on with sends (approval queue)
gmcli serve --offline            # archive queries without a phone connection
```

Auto-started daemons use the approval queue for sends — safe by design,
since nothing reaches the phone without a human approving — and log to
`<store>/daemon.log`.

**gmtui** ([`gmtui/`](gmtui/)) is a Rust/ratatui terminal client:
conversation browser, live message stream, full-text search, compose, and
the approval queue UI. After pairing once with `gmcli auth`, running `gmtui`
is all a new user needs — it brings the daemon up itself.
`cd gmtui && cargo install --path .`

**AI agents** connect through `gmcli mcp`, an MCP (Model Context Protocol)
stdio server. Read tools (`find_chats`, `search_messages`, `list_chats`,
`list_messages`, `get_message_context`, `search_contacts`, `get_status`)
work standalone against the local archive; `send_text` and
`backfill_history` go through the daemon (auto-started as needed). Search is
agent-friendly: natural-language queries fall back gracefully from FTS5
syntax to literal AND then OR term matching, results carry sender and
conversation names plus ISO timestamps, and `since`/`until` accept ISO dates
or relative durations like `7d`. Register with your agent runtime, e.g. for
Claude Code:

```sh
claude mcp add google-messages -- gmcli mcp
```

**The approval queue** is the piece that makes agent sends safe: under the
default daemon policy (`--sends approve`), an agent's `send_text` only
*proposes* a message. It lands in a local queue, gmtui pops a warning, and a
human approves (`y` in gmtui, or `gmcli approvals approve <id>`) or denies
it. Nothing touches your phone until then. `--sends direct` skips the queue
for people who trust their agents; every send still leaves an audit row.

```sh
gmcli approvals list                       # review the queue headlessly
gmcli --read-only=false approvals approve <id>   # approve = send
gmcli approvals deny <id> --reason "nope"
```

While `serve` is running, prefer the socket/MCP surface over `gmcli
sync`/`send`/`history` CLI commands on the same store — the daemon owns the
one allowed session to your phone.

## LLM integration

The first-class integration is `gmcli mcp` (see “Daemon, TUI, and agents”
above). The bundled OpenClaw skill lives in `skills/google-messages`. It is
published on ClawHub as
[Google Messages Local Archive](https://clawhub.ai/fdsouvenir/google-messages-local-archive)
(`google-messages-local-archive`) for searching, summarizing, and answering
questions from a local Google Messages SMS/RCS archive with read-only commands
by default.

## Privacy

- All data is local. gmcli does not phone home.
- Session tokens are stored in `$XDG_STATE_HOME/gmcli/session.json` with mode
  0600.
- Media attachments are referenced by ID in the database; bytes are not
  downloaded by default. Use `gmcli media download --message <message-id>`
  for explicit downloads.
- The SQLite file is unencrypted. If you need at-rest encryption, layer your
  own filesystem encryption (FileVault, LUKS, etc.).
